                Why do we call this type of dog food "human grade" dog food?
                According to the latest theories, dogs were first domesticated and started living with humans about 32,000 years ago. Although humans and dogs have been together for such a long time, it is only in recent years that dogs' diets have become more nutritionally sound. It was in 1856 that dog food was first introduced to the world. An American living in London saw that dogs enjoyed eating human cookies, so he created cookies for dogs.
                
                The nutritional difference between dogs and humans
                When we think about the quality of dog food, we must not forget to ask ourselves, "Does the food contain all the nutrients my dog needs without excess or deficiency?" Dogs and humans have different nutritional and caloric needs. If dogs were to eat the exact same diet as humans, they would either lack or have an excess of the necessary nutrients, and would not be able to maintain a healthy growth or body. If you think of "human grade" as "feeding the same food as humans," you may not be doing your dog's health any favours.

                Is giving "human grade" dog food to your dog a sign of affection?
                In recent years, as pets have become more familiar to humans, more and more pet owners consider food that meets human food safety standards to be "human grade," and feeding their pets such food is seen as a sign of affection. In accordance with this concept, some food manufacturers are using many human-grade ingredients in their dry foods. In addition, there are more and more canned foods that use exactly the same ingredients as those used in human food, so that human food and pet food are now competing with each other.
                
                The importance of thinking about pet foods through the coexistence of humans and pets
                Let's look at the world here. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations food aid agency, one in nine people still live without enough food. Furthermore, there are concerns that environmental and population problems are becoming more serious, and that an era of food shortages may be coming. In such a time, it is important to think about the ingredients of pet food from the perspective of how to share limited resources efficiently. In the first place, the nutrients and nutritional balance required by the body are different between humans and dogs. As a pet owner, you should know that there are many foods and ingredients that humans do not like to eat, but are safe for dogs and useful for maintaining their health.</p>
