Although some breeds are more susceptible than the others to hot weather, any animal can be in trouble. It's important as pet parents we understand the risks, precautions and symptoms associated with it.

Our pets do get very uncomfortable when exposed to high temperatures, like summers in certain cities in India can be quite a challenge for them, they tend to overheat.

We as humans can work with various fabrics and remove layers to ensure we feel relatively cooler even on a hot day, our pets can't do that which means it's imperative to take certain precautions with them to avoid them from falling sick.


        <br/>
        First aid for heatstroke in cats and dogs
        <br/>
Heat stroke in pets is actually a matter of emergency so if you feel your pet is overheated, its actually necessary you act immediately
<br/>
Get your pet into a cold room with air conditioner or fan. Ensuring ventilation is key.
<br/>
Gently encourage the pet to sip on some water, be careful you don't force them and get them more stressed
<br/>
Cool them down by continuously pouring small amounts of cool – lukewarm water on them. It's important not to use very cold water or ice as this can reduce blood flow to the skin, reducing their ability to cool down
<br/>
Drape a cool wet towel over animal's body and change it frequently. If the towel gets warm, it will lose its ability to lower the body temperature.
<br/>
Once you've initiated the above, call up your vet and take advise.
<br/>
If the animal is unconscious, it is emergency situation. Immediately take an action to see a veterinarian, along with the attempt listed above.
